# Burn-in-board-for-references

The PCB is used to burn in voltage references like REF0x, LT1021, LT1019 ...

Resistors R1 ... R20 can be used as load for the reference. Resistor R21 sets the current for the ON status LED diode.

Voltages can be monitor via 25 pin DB-25 connector or each reference can have it's own 2 pin 2.54mm header.
